# DIGITAL-VOTING-SYSTEM-USING-BLOCK-CHAIN

Democratic voting is a crucial and serious event in any country. The most common way in which
a country votes is through a paper based system, but is it not time to bring voting into the 21st
century of modern technology? Digital voting is the use of electronic devices, such as voting
machines or an internet browser, to cast votes. These are sometimes referred to as e-voting when
voting using a machine in a polling station, and i-voting when using a web browser.
Security of digital voting is always the biggest concern when considering to implement a digital
voting system. With such monumental decisions at stake, there can be no doubt about the
systemâ€™s ability to secure data and defend against potential attacks. One way the security issues
can be potentially solved is through the technology of blockchains.
Blockchain technology originates from the underlying architectural design of the cryptocurrency
bitcoin. It is a form of distributed database where records take the form of transactions, a block is
a collection of these transactions. With the use of blockchains a secure and robust system for 
digital voting can be devised. This report outlines our idea of how blockchain technology could
be used to implement a secure digital voting system
